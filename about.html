<h1 style="color: purple;">About Me</h1>
<ul>
	<li>I've always dreamed of one day writing software professionally.</li>
	<li>I am currently teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript in my spare time.</li>
	<li>I plan on learning other coding languages as well such as Python, C++, C#, and Java.</li>
	<li>I love learning new things and challenging myself.</li>
	<li>I also love problem solving which I feel is why I've gravitated towards computers and coding.</li>
	<li>I've been tinkering with computers since I was 5 years old and they will always have a place in my heart.</li>
	<li>I have tons of experience with the hardware side of computers, so now I want to gain software side experience as well.</li>
